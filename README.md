# Next.js Music App

Welcome to the Next.js Music App, a modern web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To get the development server up and running, execute one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application in action.

You can start making changes to the application by editing the [`app/page.tsx`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22e%3A%5C%5CSKILLS%5C%5CHITESH%20SIR%20Youtube%5C%5CNextJS%20By%20Hitesh%20Sir%5C%5CNextJS%20with%20Aceternity%20UI%5C%5Cnextjs-music-app%5C%5CREADME.md%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fe%253A%2FSKILLS%2FHITESH%2520SIR%2520Youtube%2FNextJS%2520By%2520Hitesh%2520Sir%2FNextJS%2520with%2520Aceternity%2520UI%2Fnextjs-music-app%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fe%3A%2FSKILLS%2FHITESH%20SIR%20Youtube%2FNextJS%20By%20Hitesh%20Sir%2FNextJS%20with%20Aceternity%20UI%2Fnextjs-music-app%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A81%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") file. The page will automatically update as you save your changes.

This project leverages [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for optimizing and loading Inter, a custom Google Font.
